excerpt: I am a data scientist actively seeking opportunities in the New York Metropolitan area. I am graduating from Purdue University in August with a Master of Science degree in Business Analytics and Information Management. In my 2 years of experience as a business consultant, I have worked on optimizing processes for credit cooperatives, which involved translating data insights into actionable improvements. Additionally, I gained valuable experience during my internship at an AI finance company, where I worked on refining predictive models for cardiac arrest.
