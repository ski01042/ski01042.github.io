With a passion for data science and a Master's degree in Business Analytics and Information Management from Purdue University, I aim to leverage my skills and experience to solve complex problems in finance and business operations. 

As a former business consultant for credit cooperatives, I optimized processes and developed management indicators using data analysis and visualization tools. I also designed an automation system that reduced the consulting time by 50%.

Additionally, I interned at an AI finance company, where I contributed to a predictive modeling project for cardiac arrest using deep learning and machine learning techniques, such as CNN, LSTM, DNN, and LGBM. I improved the model accuracy by 20% compared to the existing system.

I have a strong background in economics and financial engineering, with a dual bachelor's degree from Korea University and a big data and fintech training from Seoul National University. I also have multiple certifications in Python and data analysis from DataCamp.

I am eager to apply my analytical abilities and domain expertise to advance the field of data science, making a positive impact in finance and beyond.
