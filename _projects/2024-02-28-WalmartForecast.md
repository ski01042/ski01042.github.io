excerpt: The project team predicted Walmart's sales quantities across California, Texas, and Wisconsin with 5-year sales, price, and holiday data. We developed Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer. The LSTM model performed the best, with a Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (RMSSE) of 0.6860.
