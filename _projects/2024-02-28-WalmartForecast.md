excerpt: The project team predicted Walmart's sales quantities across California, Texas, and Wisconsin with 5-year sales, price, and holiday data. We developed Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer. The LSTM model performed the best, with a Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (RMSSE) of 0.6860.

## Data Exploration

Here's a really neat custom feature we added â€“ galleries:


Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

## Methodology

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.
