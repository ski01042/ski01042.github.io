title: 'Artificial Intelligence Model for the Prediction of Cardiac Arrests Using Time-Series Biometric Data'
date: 2020-07-31 00:00:00

excerpt: The project team predicted in-hospital cardiac arrests using different deep learning and machine learning models—Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM). I was responsible for managing the Deep Neural Network model. I also took charge of preprocessing the data, fine-tuning the four models, and presenting the final output. We improved the predictive accuracy by 20% compared to the existing model—Deep learning-based Early Warning System (Kwon et al., 2018)—with LSTM (for 6-hour prediction) and LGBM (for 1-hour prediction).

## Data Exploration

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:


Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

## Methodology

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.


## Model Building
