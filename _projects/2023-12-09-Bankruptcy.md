excerpt: The project team developed predictive models that combine various econometric measures and allow one to foresee a firm's financial condition. The models were evaluated in the Kaggle competition. Our team's best model was an ensemble model of Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network models, which got a 0.9182 AUC score.
