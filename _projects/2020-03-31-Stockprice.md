excerpt: The project team constructed machine learning models for stock price prediction with 9-year time series data. We predicted whether the stock price would rise or fall by developing machine learning models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The SVM model got the best AUC score (0.62). We predicted the stock price with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and ARIMA model.

## Data Exploration

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:


Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

## Methodology

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.
