excerpt: The project team engineered deep learning models for natural language translation (Portuguese to English). We developed a seq2seq model with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and a Transformer model. We evaluated the models with a BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, and the Transformer model scored 0.45, which was higher than the score of the seq2seq model (0.42).

## Data Exploration

Here's a really neat custom feature we added â€“ galleries:


Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

## Methodology

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.
