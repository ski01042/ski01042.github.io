excerpt: Daniels School of Business Excellence in Business Insights Award Winner. The project team used the LEGO Brick Database to devise a data visualization to address the questionâ€”How did a simple children's toy become a sophisticated hobby for adults? I created a bar chart race, line charts, and bubble charts to find out the trends of LEGO data. Moreover, I constructed an interactive dashboard to provide more insights about LEGO trends and builders.
